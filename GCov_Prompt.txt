Gcov prompt

When using a way to look at how coverage is being changed by Generated Tests it seems that the GCov result from below has roughly 86.6% coverage. With this in mind this is going to be the base that we use to try and increase that percentage. 

Looking at GCov output I want you to identify the areas where tests are lacking, and output possible tests. When outputting follow these steps.

Step 1: Confirm the method signature from provided files.
Step 2: Generate code explicitly based on confirmed signatures.
Step 3: Flag missing or ambiguous information.
Step 4: Suggest tests or static assertions to validate behavior.
Step 5: Output well-documented, assumption-free code.

 Please output the code into one file and a matching .hpp
