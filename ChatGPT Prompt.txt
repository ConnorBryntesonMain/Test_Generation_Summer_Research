ChatGPT Prompt

I am working on generating tests with AI that add to coverage and that compile and run right after generation. For this the generation must follow these steps.

Step 1: Confirm the method signature from provided files.
Step 2: Generate code explicitly based on confirmed signatures.
Step 3: Flag missing or ambiguous information.
Step 4: Suggest tests or static assertions to validate behavior.
Step 5: Output well-documented, assumption-free code.
Step 6: Ensure the code generated will increase coverage

#This is program specific stuff so this would change depending on 
Use Linux MPI system for compatibility: The code must be compatible with the Linux MPI system setup, which includes initializing and finalizing MPI correctly, and ensuring the code works within a distributed and parallel execution environment.
When creating the file it must be created using only existing files that I give the system.

If the code does not meet these requirements then it should be rewritten to meet the requirements provided. 

The file provided is the code we are going to be working with in the chat.
