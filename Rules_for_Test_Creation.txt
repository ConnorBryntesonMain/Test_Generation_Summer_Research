Initialization:

Use initialization functions like InitializeVector only for memory allocation.
Assign specific values to objects manually after initialization using loops or helpers.

Header Management:

Include all required headers explicitly.
Organize headers into groups: Standard library, External libraries, and Project-specific.
Avoid relying on transitive includes.

Direct Member Access:

Do not use object->member for accessing properties.
Use public members (e.g., A.localNumberOfRows) or accessor methods like GetLocalNumberOfRows().

Parameter Validation:

Ensure all parameters are validated before usage, using assertions or conditionals.
Confirm values like sizes and dimensions are positive and consistent.
Documentation:

Provide structured comments for test functions, including:

Purpose
Parameters (names, types, roles)
Expected behavior and outcomes.

Edge Case Handling:

Include tests for edge cases like zero-sized inputs, large inputs, and non-standard values (NaN, infinity).
Ensure the program handles these cases gracefully.
